->Covid-19_Detection_EfficientNet-B0-to-B7
Performance evaluation of EfficientNet models for identifying covid-19 using chest x-ray images.

Description: Early identification of covid-19 helps to control the wide spread of the disease. For controlling such diseases, limited diagnostic techniques are available and one of them is computer diagnosis or medical imaging techniques using deep learning approach. The purpose of this project work is to evaluate and analyze the performance of different EfficientNet models in detecting covid-19 from chest x-ray images. EfficientNet models gives the best results when compared to other pre-trained models. The dataset used comprised of a total of 2196 chest radiography images, categorized into normal vs covid-19 classes. A minimal preprocessing has been done before it is fed to the model, i.e, resizing every image to it's corresponding dimensions. The tools and packages used are Google Colaboratory (web IDE for python) and Scikit learn (open source, simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis). Python language is used as the tool for implementing the model.

OBJECTIVE:
1.To evaluate the performance of various EfficientNet models
on the chest x-ray images for detecting covid-19.
2.To identify the best EfficientNet model for the detection of
covid-19.

CONCLUSION:
#EfficientNetB7 is the best model for covid-19 detection.
#It gives higher model accuracy (97.5%) with very less loss of
only 4.3%.
#Higher image resolution (600 × 600), uses more layers and
channels.
#cohen’s kappa score: 0.98
